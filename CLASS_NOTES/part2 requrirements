Part 2: Web access

The current weather data is fetched from an  API of  OpenWeatherMap.org:  https://openweathermap.org/current
Scroll down to the heading "By ZIP code" and you will see the orange color API call, which makes up the example URL:
                http: api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?zip=94040,us

In the example above, the zip is 94040 (Mountain View). With the URL you also need to append 2 more strings:
1.  the string:    &units=imperial          so the temperature will be in Fahrenheit instead of the default Kelvin temperature
2.  your key, which is a multi-digit hexadecimal string, such as:      &APPID=23d3a44948b47338224e4904


The  complete URL in your code would look something like this:
http: api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?zip=94040,us&units=imperial&APPID=23d3a44948b47338224e4904

To obtain a key, click on the "sign up" link of the OpenWeatherMap link above. You need a log in id, an email address, and a password. You only sign up for the free account, which limits you to 60 data fetches per minute maximum (which should be more than enough to complete this lab).

For the cities used in this lab, the list of zip codes is:
[92093, 90013, 95192, 94132, 94720, 95064, 95819, 92697, 93940, 94544]
which you can store as a class variable or a global variable..

As the OpenWeatherMap website states, the data you download from the API is JSON format.
Each data record is fairly large, with nested structures, so it is useful to download it to a JSON file with indentation so it's easier to see the relationship between the data values (dictionary of dictionaries or dictionary of list of dictionary)

Out of each data record you need 3 data values:  the city 'name', the 'temp', and the weather condition 'description'
All quoted strings are fields that you should look for.
The city names that are displayed in the dialog window are extracted from the API downloaded data. Don't hard code the city names yourself
